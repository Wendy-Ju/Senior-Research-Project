Project owner on Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification to predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI scans by employing 3D-CNN and 3D-ResNet models with feature extraction and concatenation strategies.
Built methods to complete 3D data augmentation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with animations and modeling.
Adopted hyperparameter tuning and increased the AUC score to 62%, which transcended 85% of the existing prediction results
